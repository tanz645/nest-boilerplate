### Issue Types

- **Bug Report**: Something isn't working as expected
- **Feature Request**: Suggest an idea for this project
- **Documentation**: Improvements or additions to documentation

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`

### NestJS Patterns

- Follow NestJS conventions and best practices
- Use dependency injection properly
- Implement proper error handling
- Use DTOs for request/response validation
- Follow the existing module structure

### File Organization

- Keep related files together in modules
- Use barrel exports (`index.ts`) for clean imports
- Follow the existing directory structure:
  ```
  src/
  â”œâ”€â”€ module-name/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dto/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entities/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ transformers/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ exceptions/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ module.controller.ts
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ module.service.ts
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ module.module.ts
  ```

### Database

- Use Mongoose schemas with proper validation
- Include timestamps in entities
- Use proper indexing for performance
- Follow the existing entity patterns

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Write unit tests for services and utilities
- Use Jest testing framework
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for good test coverage

### Integration Tests

- Write integration tests for controllers
- Test API endpoints with real database
- Use test database for integration tests

### E2E Tests

- Write end-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Test authentication and authorization flows
- Test API responses and error handling

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Coverage
npm run test:cov

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md for significant changes
- Add JSDoc comments for new public APIs
- Update API documentation if endpoints change
- Include examples in documentation

## Security

- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow security best practices
- Report security vulnerabilities privately
